# make a sample calculator using python function

# define the function with passing arguements
def cal(a,b):
    print("simple calculator : \n")
    print(f"Addition : {a+b}")
    print(f"Substract : {a-b}")
    print(f"Multiplication : {a*b}")
    print(f"Division : {a/b}")
    print(f"power : {a**b}")

# call/Invoke the function
cal(345,5)
cal(54,6)
cal(79,9)

# you can only define code at one time in function (that is encapsulate) and then call again it agian with passing different arguements so this is code resuable and not bulky!!

# It offers code resuability
# modularity
# clean & concise
# easy to understand
# debugging program easily
